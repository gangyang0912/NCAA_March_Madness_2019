Investigated the “homecourt advantage” and checked how homecourt contributed to the difference in score by using KS test, two sample T-test, Monte Carlo simulation and Mann-Whitney U test

Selected 26 features from the game and encoded the gaming results into a binary variable; Applied linear SVM and random forest to select features 

Confirmed the advantage of homecourt conditions based on the testing accuracy: SVM (93.2), logistic regression (88.6)
